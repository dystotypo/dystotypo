        <p>For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was
            normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in thelonger wall, opposite the window.
            To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were
            built, had probably been intended to hold <span class="memory">bookshelves</span>.By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston
            was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course,
            but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual geography of
            the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do. But it had also been suggested by
            the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful <span class="memory">book</span>.</p>
