      <h1>Brave New World</h1>
<h3>Author:  Aldous Huxley</h3>
<h3>One</h3>
<p>A squat  grey building of only thirty-four stories. Over the main entrance the words, <a href="">CENTRAL LONDON</a> HATCHERY AND CONDITIONING CENTRE, and, in a shield, the World State's motto, <b>COMMUNITY, IDENTITY, STABILITY</b>. </p>

<p>The enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. Cold for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables. </p>
<p>"And this," said the Director opening the door, "is the Fertilizing Room."</p>

<p>Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director's heels. Each of them carried a <span class="memory">notebook</span>, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight from the horse's mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D. H. C. for<a href=""> Central London</a> always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments. </p>
<p>"Just to give you a general idea," he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently-though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for virture and happiness; <span class="truth">generalities</span> are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers but fretsawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society. </p>
<p><span class="time">"To-morrow"</span>, he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality, "you'll be settling down to serious work. You won't have time for generalities. Meanwhileâ€¦"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it was a privilege. Straight from the horse's mouth into the notebook. The boys scribbled like mad. </p>
<p>Tall and rather thin but upright, the Director advanced into the room. He had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth, just covered, when he was not talking, by his full, floridly curved lips. Old, young? Thirty? Fifty? Fifty-five? It was hard to say. And anyhow the question didn't arise; in this year of stability, <span class="time">A. F. 632</span>, it didn't occur to you to ask it. </p>
<p>"I shall begin at the beginning," said the D.H.C. and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their notebooks: Begin at the beginning. "These," he waved his hand, "are the incubators." And opening an insulated door he showed them <span class="truth">explained</span>, "at blood heat; whereas the male gametes," and here he opened another door, "they have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven. Full blood heat sterilizes." Rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs. Still leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the pencils scurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern fertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduction-"the operation undergone voluntarily for the good of Society, not to mention the fact that it carries a bonus amounting to <span class="time">six months' salary</span>"; continued with some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and actively developing; passed on to a consideration of optimum temperature, salinity, viscosity; referred to the liquor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept; and, leading his charges to the work tables, actually showed them how this liquor was drawn off from the test-tubes; how it was let out drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa-at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted out of the liquor and its contents re-examined; how, if any of the eggs remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again; how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators; where the Alphas and Betas remained until definitely bottled; while the Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons were brought out again, after only thirty-six hours, to undergo Bokanovsky's Process. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="./img/AI/test tubes and notes.png" style="height: 400px;"></p>

<p>"Bokanovsky's Process," repeated the Director, and the students underlined the words in their little notebooks. </p>
<p>One egg, one embryo, one adult-normality. But a bokanovskified egg will bud, will proliferate, will divide. From eight to ninety-six buds, and every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo into a full-sized adult. Making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before. <span class="truth">Progress</span>. </p>
<p>"Essentially," the D.H.C. concluded, "bokanovskification consists of a series of arrests of development. We check the normal growth and, paradoxically enough, the egg responds by budding." </p>
<p>Responds by budding. The pencils were busy. </p>
<p>He pointed. On a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was entering a large metal box, another, rack-full was emerging. Machinery faintly purred. It took <span class="time">eight minutes</span> for the tubes to go through, he told them. <span class="time">Eight minutes</span> of hard X-rays being about as much as an egg can stand. A few died; of the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop; then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. Two, four, eight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to death with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded-bud out of bud out of bud-were thereafter-further arrest being generally fatal-left to develop in peace. By which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos-a prodigious <span class="memory">improvement</span>, you will agree, on nature. Identical twins-but not in piddling twos and threes as in the <span class="memory">old viviparous days</span>, when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide; actually by dozens, by scores at a time. </p>
<p>"Scores," the Director <span class="truth">repeated</span> and flung out his arms, as though he were distributing largesse. "Scores." </p>
<p>But one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay. </p>
<p>"My good boy!" The Director wheeled sharply round on him. "<span class="truth">Can't you see?</span> Can't you see?" He raised a hand; his expression was solemn. "Bokanovsky's Process is one of the major instruments of social stability!" Major instruments of social stability. </p>
<p> Standard men and women; in uniform batches. The whole of a small factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg. </p>
<p>"Ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines!" The voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. "You really know where you are. For the first time in <span class="memory">history</span>." He quoted the planetary motto. <b>"Community, Identity, Stability"</b>. Grand words. "If we could bokanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved." </p>
<p>Solved by standard Gammas, unvarying Deltas, uniform Epsilons. Millions of identical twins. The principle of mass production at last applied to biology. </p>
<p>"But, alas," the Director shook his head, "we can't bokanovskify indefinitely." Ninety-six seemed to be the limit; seventy-two a good average. From the same ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as many batches of identical twins as possible-that was the best (sadly a second best) that they could do. And even that was difficult. </p>
<p>"For in nature it takes <span class="time">thirty years</span> for two hundred eggs to reach maturity. But our business is to stabilize the population at this moment, here and <span class="time">now</span>. Dribbling out twins over a <span class="time">quarter of a century</span>-what would be the use of that?" Obviously, no use at all. But Podsnap's Technique had immensely accelerated the process of ripening. They could make sure of at least a hundred and fifty mature eggs within <span class="time">two years</span>. Fertilize and bokanovskify-in other words, multiply by seventy-two-and you get an average of nearly eleven thousand brothers and sisters in a hundred and fifty batches of identical twins, all within two years of the same age. </p>
<p>"And in <span class="memory">exceptional cases</span> we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen thousand adult individuals." </p>
<p>Beckoning to a fair-haired, ruddy young man who happened to be passing at the moment. "Mr. Foster," he called. The ruddy young man approached. "Can you tell us the <span class="memory">record</span> for a single ovary, Mr. Foster?" </p>
<p>"Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre," Mr. Foster replied without hesitation. He spoke very quickly, had a vivacious blue eye, and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures. "Sixteen thousand and twelve; in one hundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals. But of course they've done much better," he rattled on, "in some of the tropical Centres. <a href="">Singapore</a> has often produced over sixteen thousand five hundred; and <a href="">Mombasa</a> has actually touched the seventeen thousand mark. But then they have unfair advantages. You should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary! It's quite astonishing, when you're used to working with European material. Still," he added, with a laugh (but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was challenging), "still, we mean to beat them if we can. I'm working on a wonderful Delta-Minus ovary at this moment. Only just <span class="time">eighteen months old</span>. Over twelve thousand seven hundred children already, either decanted or in embryo. And still going strong. We'll beat them yet." </p>
<p>"That's the spirit I like!" cried the Director, and clapped Mr. Foster on the shoulder. </p>
